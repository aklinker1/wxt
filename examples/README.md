# WXT Examples

When running the examples inside the WXT Monorepo, make sure to build WXT first from the root directory, then run the example's dev command:

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm build

cd examples/i18n
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

If you're looking for examples of how to setup a frontend framework like Vue or React, see the [`templates/` directory](https://github.com/aklinker1/wxt/tree/main/templates) instead.
