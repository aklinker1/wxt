# Changelog

## v1.0.0

Extracted `wxt/storage` into it's own package, `@wxt-dev/storage`!

It's still shipped inside WXT and accessible via `wxt/storage`, but now:

- Non-WXT projects can use the storage wrapper.
- We can make breaking changes to the API separately.

[Read the docs](https://wxt.dev/storage.html) for more details.

> This is apart of the v1.0 initiative for WXT.
